Test Case 1: Verify user login
Test Case 2: Upload document to Knowledge Base
Test Case 3: Query AI with uploaded document
Test Case 4: Run autonomous agent task
Test Case 5: Validate AI response accuracy
Test Case 6: Verify user login credentials
This test case verifies that the user is able to log in to the system with valid credentials.
Test Case 7: Upload document and verify it appears in Knowledge Base
This test case uploads a new document to the Knowledge Base and verifies that it appears in the list of documents.
Test Case 8: Query AI with invalid input data
This test case queries the AI system with invalid input data (e.g., a document that is not formatted correctly) and verifies that the AI system responds appropriately.
Test Case 9: Run autonomous agent task with no documents available
This test case runs an autonomous agent task without any documents available in the Knowledge Base and verifies that the AI system responds appropriately.
Test Case 10: Validate AI response accuracy with multiple documents
This test case validates the accuracy of the AI response by querying it with multiple documents and comparing the results to a known correct output.
Test Case 11: Verify user can upload documents from different sources
This test case verifies that the user is able to upload documents from different sources (e.g., a PDF, DOCX, or TXT file) and that they are processed correctly by the AI system.
Test Case 12: Validate AI response accuracy with different input data formats
This test case validates the accuracy of the AI response by querying it with different input data formats (e.g., PDF, DOCX, TXT) and comparing the results to a known correct output.
Test Case 13: Verify user can download documents from Knowledge Base
This test case verifies that the user is able to download documents from the Knowledge Base and that they are stored locally on the user's device.
Test Case 14: Validate AI response accuracy with different document types
This test case validates the accuracy of the AI response by querying it with different types of documents (e.g., PDF, DOCX, TXT) and comparing the results to a known correct output.
Test Case 15: Verify user can search for documents in Knowledge Base
This test case verifies that the user is able to search for documents in the Knowledge Base using various search terms and that they are returned with appropriate relevance.
