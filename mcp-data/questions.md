# Secure Coding – ISO/IEC 27002:2022

---

## Q1. What is the purpose of secure coding according to ISO/IEC 27002?
Secure coding ensures that software is designed and implemented to prevent the introduction of vulnerabilities that could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information. ISO/IEC 27002 emphasizes embedding security controls during development to reduce risk proactively.

## Q2. How does ISO/IEC 27002 address input validation in software development?
ISO/IEC 27002 recommends validating all input data to prevent common attacks such as injection, buffer overflows, and cross-site scripting. Input validation should enforce checks on data type, length, format, and acceptable values before processing.
